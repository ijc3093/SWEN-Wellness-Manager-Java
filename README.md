# Execution instruction :computer:
  There are **2** ways that the application can be executed. <br/> There's a **CLI(Command Line Interface)** Version and a **GUI(Default)** Version.
  - To run the **CLI version** you have to specifically run the **CLI.java class**.
  - To run the **GUI version** just run the **WellnessManager.java class**.

# Known Bugs :mosquito:
 There is **1** known bug :unamused: in the code currently. Everytime when you run the application, you will be hit with a **blank Java Application window** and it won't display anything. <br/>
 
**Luckily we have a manual fix!** :wrench:
  - **Windows**
    - You have to minimize and then unminimize the application and that will fix it. 
  - **Mac**
    - You have to resize the application a little bit and that will fix it.
